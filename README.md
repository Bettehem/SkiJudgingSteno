# SkiJudgingSteno
This android app is intended to make judging at Skiing events a lot easier(support for sowboard events will be implemented at a later stage, when everything is working regarding the skiing part of things). The aim is to possibly one day, do judging at Slopestyle and half pipe events without paper!
This app targets users, who are people that do judging, and have done it before, and this app will not teach you how to judge!

Here are some of the features that this app will have:

-You can add events and save them for later use.
-You can add profiles for events. This means that details for events will not have to be written every time, such as: is the event slopestyle or half pipe, are the people competing using skis or snowboards etc. and you can just save a profile when creating an event, and the details from that profile will be loaded and added to the details of that event for you.
-You can add custom markings for tricks
-At first, you will be able to use the app in Finnish and English. More translations will possibly be added in the future.
-You will be able to analyze each run later
-You can display scores you gave each skier/snowboarder separately, or all at once
-While giving scores to the competitor, the app will assist you with the score and ranking
-You will be able to send results via email



For the best experience, a device with a relatively large screen is recommended.
