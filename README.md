# SkiJudgingSteno
This android app is intended to make judging at Skiing events(support for snowboard events will be implemeted at a later stage, when everything is working regarding the skiing part of things) a lot easier. The aim is to possibly one day, do judging at Slopestyle and half pipe events without paper!
This apps target users, are people that do judging, and have done it before, and this app will not teach you how to judge!
The app will function somewhat as following:

-You can add events and save them for later use.
-You can add profiles for events. This means that details for events will not have to be written every time, such as is the event slopestyle or half pipe, are the people competing using skis or snowboards etc. and you can just save a profile when creating an event, and the details from that profile will be loaded and added to the details of that event for you.
-You can add custom markings for tricks
-At first, you will be able to use the app in Finnish and English. More translations will possibly be added in the future.
-You will be able to analyze each run later
-You can display scores you gave each skier/snowboarder separately, or all at once
-While giving scores to the competitor, the app will assist you with the score and ranking
